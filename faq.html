            <br>Absolutely. We offer a free trial week of classes of any of our classes on our regular schedule, with the exception of sparring. You are able to take multiple 
                classes during your trial day and use the facillty during normal business hours.

            <br><strong>How do I get a free trial? Do I need an appointment?</strong><br>
            <br>We do offer a free trial class during Covid. We ask that you send us an email directly at info@warriorfitMMA.com or call us at 956-655-1251 
                to reserve a class. We have gone to a reservation based sytem to stay safe during covid.<br>

            <br>If you are under 18 you will need to bring a parent or guardian to sign a waiver form. We offer free trials to new clients who are local residents.

            <br><strong>What do I need to bring to a Kickboxing/MMA Class?</strong><br>
            <br>We ask that you provide your own equipment for the kickboxing/MMA classes for general health reasons. We will cannot provide loaner gloves due to Covid restricitons.
                Dress in comfortable workout attire (tshirt & shorts or workout pants) and bring your own towel. Classes are taught barefoot unless you have boxing/wrestling shoes.

            <br><strong>What do I need to bring to a Jiu-Jitsu Class?</strong><br>
            <br>Since we offer both GI and NO GI Jiu Jitsu classes, we ask that you dress appropriately for each class. The GI classes require a GI (with the exception of your free trial day). 
                We do not have an official "GI dress code" and allow any belt level to wear any color GI. For NO GI classes we ask that you wear a rashguard or tight fitting shirt with MMA 
                style shorts (no pockets, zippers or button) or compression pants.
