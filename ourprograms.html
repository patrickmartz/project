            <br><strong>WOMEN'S PROGRAM</strong><br>
            Our women’s martial arts program is designed to teach women how to defend against any attacker – even those who are significantly larger in size. Our instructors
            will help you run drills to simulate realistic attack and escape situations you might encounter in the real world. With practice, you can leverage an attacker’s 
            weight against them, allowing you to escape and get to safety unharmed. The self-defense techniques taught in this class use Jiu-Jitsu fundamentals that complement
            our selection of additional adult classes.
