                Instructors shall teach a class as a privilege and never take it as a burden. Each class is the realization of a dream, the instructor lifeâ€™s work. 
                They must enjoy every minute of it and teach like it was going to be their last opportunity to change students lives for better. Instructors shall constantly discipline the students but never punish them. 
                They must make students understand that without discipline there is no mastery, neither in Jiu-Jitsu nor in life, and that without the willingness to sacrifice, excellence is just not possible.
